This is a sample of Ryu controller for referrence

controller: ryu core tar package
Ryu-3.23.tar.gz is from https://github.com/osrg/ryu/releases/tag/v3.23
This is the official release package of version-3.23

app: applications of 3rd-party and developped by meshsr
1. 3rd-party: third-party plug-in
Recently it is empty, later we may bring in other plug-ins

2. applications developped by meshsr: begin with prefix "msr-"
Recently just a simple switch example msr-simple_switch
modified from official source ryu/app/simple_switch_13.py
Later we may add other applications.

How to compose these files and install ryu
1. download the repo to your local position <git_repo>
    mkdir git_repo
    cd git_repo/
    git clone https://github.com/MeshSr/of-ctrl
2. untar the Ryu-3.23 package to <proj_name>
    mkdir proj_name
    cd proj_name
    tar xvf git_repo/ryu/controller/Ryu-3.23.tar.gz
3. copy all the appliactions to proj_name/ryu-3.23/ryu/app/
    cp git_repo/of-ctrl/ryu/app/* proj_name/ryu-3.23/ryu/app/ -rf
4. install ryu
    cd proj_name/ryu-3.23/
    sudo python setup.py install

NOTE:
This step may need some extra dependent libraries, please download and install them first

How to use the web gui 
1. ./bin/ryu-manager --verbose --observe-links ryu/app/gui_topology/gui_topology.py
2. open the web browser, and type in "localhost:8080", then you will see the web interface

How to use simple switch example
1. ./bin/ryu-manager --verbose ryu/app/msr-simple_switch/simple_switch_13.py

NOTE:
We have modified the original source file, because we configure
our switches' packet-in packets with packet-buffered by default

So we use the file simple_switch_13.py of previous verison of ryu<ryu-3.8>
to replace the same file of ryu-3.23

Otherwise there maybe a lot of packet-in events,
and the ofsoftswitch13 will write the packet-in entry all the time
